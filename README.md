# NLPMVA

We launched trainings on colab.

CompoLazImpaTraining.pynb to train the classical pipeline

ChildrenTraining.pynb to train the children system

LazImpa_notebook_replicate_paper.pynb for the replication of results of the paper

The other files are used by these notebooks automatically so they aren't really important (they are pretrained models or distributions).
